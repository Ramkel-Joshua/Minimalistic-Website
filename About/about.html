                <p>
                    We are building a website from scratch in order to practice html and css. As you can see, we used some text from lorem ipsum as a convenient placeholder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While at it, please let us know if we could improve the design further to make it a nice website. By the way, we plan to add more enhancements to the site. Before you know it, we will have a serious looking website.
